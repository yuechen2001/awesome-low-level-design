## What You Did Well
- **State Pattern Implementation:** Successfully implemented the State design pattern to manage different vending machine states, aligning with the standard solution approach.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Effectively separated responsibilities between the main Machine class and individual state classes.
- **Error Handling:** Included proper exception handling for invalid operations, such as insufficient funds.
- **Change Calculation:** Implemented a simple yet effective change-return system.
- **Product and Inventory Management:** Managed product and inventory effectively to track available items.

## Areas for Improvement
- **Singleton Pattern:** The standard solution uses the Singleton pattern for the VendingMachine class to ensure a single instance. Your implementation lacks this, potentially leading to multiple instances.
- **Parameter Design:** While you used a general Cash class, the standard solution uses specialized classes for currency (Coin and Note), providing better type safety.
- **Method Naming:** Descriptive method names like `updateCollectedAmount()` are used, but they expose implementation details. The standard solution prefers higher-level names like `addCoin()` and `addNote()`.
- **Method Parameters:** The standard solution's state methods rely on the selected product stored in the machine, avoiding the need to pass product parameters for methods like `dispenseProduct()` and `returnChange()`, reducing coupling.
- **Direct State Access:** In the standard solution, states access vending machine methods directly. Your approach uses callback methods, adding indirection but remains effective.

## Overall Assessment
**Grade: B+**

Your implementation meets all functional requirements and demonstrates a solid understanding of object-oriented design principles, especially the State pattern. The code is well-structured with proper exception handling.

The main differences from the standard solution are design choices rather than functional issues. The standard solution uses more specialized classes and the Singleton pattern, which are beneficial for production code. However, your implementation is fully functional and demonstrates strong software engineering principles.

For future improvements, consider implementing the Singleton pattern where appropriate and creating more specialized currency classes to enhance type safety.
